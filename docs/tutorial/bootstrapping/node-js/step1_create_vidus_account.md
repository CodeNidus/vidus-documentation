# Create a Vidus account

To begin, create a Vidus user account on the [Vidus Admin Panel](https://admin.vidus.app) website. Sign up for free and validate your account using the verification link sent to your registered email address.

After successfully logging into the dashboard, navigate to the Projects section. In the projects list, you will find a pre-built trial project with a one-week validation period.
Once this period expires, you must choose a subscription plan to reactivate your project.

In the Projects List section, select the trial project to open its overview page. Here, you will find your project’s **app_id** and **secret key**. Copy these values and keep them for the next steps.
